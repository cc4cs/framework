Notes: 
- Change Legacy Name 
init.py --> chosenMicro - chosenProcedure
- The function ExecuteCommandSet works only with the simulation procedure
- Not the clear the function of the resultFile in the executeCommandSet procedure
- the program takes the commands when it choses the data, it does not make any sense with the static  analysis feature
- creaton of the directories at the beginning of the computation does not make sense in this new version
- delete the if statement in chosenMicro
