Test: "Invalid Input" 

In my implementation of matrix multiplication, first of all, I check if the number of rows of the first matrix is equal to the number of columns of the second matrix.

if(column_num_a != row_num_b) 
	return 1;

Problem: If I insert this check and an input that allow us to enter in the if, the framework crashes at: "Running ISASIM for SDCC program simulation"

If I delete this check in the algorithm, the framework does all in the right manner.

So at the moment, I will do the tests only with "good" inputs.

Internal error: validateLink failed in SPEC_NOUN(type) @ /home/sdcc-builder/build/sdcc-build/orig/sdcc/src/SDCCsymt.c:2072: expected SPECIFIER, got null-link

Error in an older version of sdcc?
