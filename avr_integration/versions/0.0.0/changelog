- mipsc.pl :
-* parse gcov and isasim oputputs
-* compute TPI avarage, CCPI avarage and variance
-* report
-** report for each input incite: number of executed instruction, execution time, TPI, CCPI
-** report CCPI min, max, avarage, variance, standard deviation.
- mipsc.sh :
-* calls makefile and mipsc.pl in order to perform the whole mipsc calculation process.
